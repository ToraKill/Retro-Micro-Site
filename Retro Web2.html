  Doraemon is a popular Japanese manga and anime series created by Fujiko F. Fujio.
   The series revolves around the adventures of a robotic cat named Doraemon, who 
   travels back in time from the 22nd century to help a young boy named Nobita Nobi 
   with his everyday problems.

In the series, Doraemon was created by a fictional Japanese company called "Robotics 
Corporation." According to the story, Doraemon was sent back in time to the present day
 to help Nobita because his descendants were suffering from his misfortunes.

Doraemon is known for his various gadgets, which he pulls out of his "fourth-dimensional

  machines and flying umbrellas. With his gadgets, Doraemon helps Nobita overcome his problems and teaches him valuable life lessons along the way.

The popularity of the Doraemon franchise has led to numerous adaptations and spin-offs,
